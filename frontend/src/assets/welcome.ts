# INTRODUCTION

Hello there! This site is pretty much similar to Hastebin but offers both file and paste hosting.
Files and pastes are not guaranteed to be stored forever and may be deleted at any time in order
to reserve storage for new uploads.

# HOW TO UPLOAD PASTES

To upload a paste, just start typing and this message will dissappear automatically. Once done,
you can simply press CTRL+S or right-click and press "Save" to retrieve a unique link for your paste.
It may be shared to others, however, once the file expires, this link will stop working.

# HOW TO UPLOAD FILES

To upload a file, simply drag a file into this window, or right-click and press "Upload". Then
select a file and click on "Open" and your file will start uploading. Once finished, same thing with pastes,
you receive a unique link to your upload.
