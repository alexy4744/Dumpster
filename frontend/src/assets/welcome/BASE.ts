Hello there! This site is pretty much similar to Hastebin but offers both file and paste hosting.
Files and pastes may last up to 1 month, however it may be deleted earlier due to our FIFO to reserve
storage for new uploads.

export const paste: string = `
To upload a paste, just start typing and this message will dissappear automatically. Once done,
you can simply press CTRL+S or right-click and press "Save" to retrieve a unique link for your paste.
It may be shared to others, however, once the file expires, this link will stop working.

export const upload: string = `
To upload a file, simply drag a file into this window, or right-click and press "Upload". Then
select a file and click on "Open" and your file will start uploading. Once finished, same thing with pastes,
